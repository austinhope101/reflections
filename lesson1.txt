Viewing the difference between 2 files using diff helped me see the introduced bug by highlighting what changes were made between old and the new file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term? 
You can take a look at your history and learn from your mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does ?
Pro -save space, not too many commits
Con -forgeting to save

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Programming requires more than one file for a programm to work as opposed to a word text file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files? 
git log shows you the commits while git diff shows you differences in those commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You can always revert back to a previous version if something goes wrong and its also easier to tell where things went array

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Look into projects on github
